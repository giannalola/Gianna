<h4>Another system of the body is the endocrine system, which includes many glands that help the body function....BIG TIME. One of the glands are the adrenal glands. See the connection: Adrenal-Adrenaline. This gland does it's job when you are scared. One other gland is the thyroid. The thyroid does it's job by sending and reciving messages to and from your brain to produce and release two thyroid hormones.</h4>
